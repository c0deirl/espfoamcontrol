# espfoamcontrol
Software and design for the Foam Machine. 

This program is for an ESP32 to control a 12v motor, and allow variable foam output. It uses a rotary encoder and a web interface to control the speed, and an H-Bridge to allow for PWM speed control. 
Additional features will be included such as relay control for a solenoid, to inject color dye into the foam stream.
